get_next_line_LOGIC

purpose: write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

tools:
	read (system call) to read from a file descriptor
	malloc (function) to allocate memory
	free (function) to free memory
	libft (functions) memory and string manipulation

structure:
	int		get_next_line(const int fd, char **line)

parameters:
	int fd, which refers to the file descriptor used to read from.
	char **line, which is the address of a pointer to a character that will be used to save 	the line read from the file descriptor.

return:
	1	if the line has been read.
	0	if the reading is completed
	-1	if an error has occured

* the lines read from the file descriptor must be returned without '\n'

-------------------------------------

EXAMPLE:

file.txt
	"aaaa
	bbb
	cccccc"

	"aaaa\nbb\ncccccc\n"

*line[0] = "aaaa"

with each call of get_next_line, the function should read the next line in the file

--------------------------------------

break the problem down into its simplest steps:

1) determine the file descriptor being read from and store value in an int fd

	types of file descriptors:
		default open files: (file number: 0) stdin, (1) stdout, (2) stderr
		text file
		redirection...

2) declare and initialize the character array which will store the line

3) declare and allocate size to a buffer (character array which will temporarily store
	characters as file is being read)

4) read BUFF_SIZE bytes from fd to buffer

5) use str to catch each line in the buffer string (line delimited by '\n')
	a) when a line is stored in str, allocate size for it in the string array *line[i]
		i) store the line in the string array line, ending the string with '\0'
	b) repeat until all lines from the buffer string have been stored in a character array pointed to by *line[i].
	c) if there are leftover characters that do not end with '\n'....
		?

6) continue to read from fd to buffer and repeat (5) until EOF is reached.


things that are unclear:
	how to know when EOF is reached ?
	how to store substrings in str from buffer delimited by '\n' or a partial substring?
	how and when the pointers to the character arrays are allocated?
